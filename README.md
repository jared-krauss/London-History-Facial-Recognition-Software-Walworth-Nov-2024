# London-History-Facial-Recognition-Software-Walworth-Nov-2024
This is for viewing a Gaussian Splat model of the London Metropolitan Police's deployment of a facial recognition technology van to Walworth Road in London, UK in November, 2024, as documented by Jared Krauss, and created using his Nikon, and open source computational computer vision and object recognition software such as Colmap and OpenSplat, mimicking the computational vision, or as Harun Farocki would put it, mimicking the "operative image" of the police's surveillance instigating interventions by them with members of the public based on algorithims.
